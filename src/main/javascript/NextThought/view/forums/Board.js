	 * I'm not sure there will be a visual component mapping to a list of boards. I think we will simply list the
	 * contents of all viewable boards as a flat list of Forums. So this container will be nearly symbolic to its
	 * relation to the models.
	 *
	 * This will contain a flattened list of Forums.
	 *
	 * When a user selects one we will add that view (Forum) onto the stack, suppressing this one. (The stack and impl
	 * to be handled in the controller)
