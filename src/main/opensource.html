		<p>
			Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not <br>allowed.<br>
			<br>
			This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General <br>Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
			<br>
			0. Additional Definitions.<br>
			As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to <br>version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
			<br>
			&quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
			<br>
			An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the <br>Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
			<br>
			A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the <br>Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked Version&quot;.<br>
			<br>
			The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any <br>source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the <br>Linked Version.<br>
			<br>
			The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, <br>including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System <br>Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
			<br>
			1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
			You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
			<br>
			2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
			If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an <br>Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a <br>copy of the modified version:<br>
			<br>
			a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply <br>the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
			b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.<br>
			3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
			The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey<br> such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical <br>parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in <br>length), you do both of the following:<br>
			<br>	
			a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are <br>covered by this License.<br>
			b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
			4. Combined Works.<br>
			You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the <br>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do<br> each of the following:<br>
			<br>
			a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use <br>are covered by this License.<br>
			b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
			c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among <br>these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
			d) Do one of the following:<br>
			0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form <br>suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the <br>Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying <br>Corresponding Source.<br>
			1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time <br>a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of <br>the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.<br>
			e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of<br> the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the <br>Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use <br>option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If<br> you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for <br>conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
			5. Combined Libraries.<br>
			You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other <br>library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under <br>terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
			<br>
			a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library <br>facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
			b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find <br>the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
			6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
			The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to <br>time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or <br>concerns.<br>
			<br>
			Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered <br>version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the <br>terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the<br> Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any <br>version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
			<br>
			If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public <br>License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose <br>that version for the Library.<br>
